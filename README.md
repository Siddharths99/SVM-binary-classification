## SVM Binary Classification on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW) dataset. Both Linear and RBF kernels are used, and hyperparameters are tuned for improved performance. Decision boundaries are visualized for better understanding of model behavior.
